# Security Policy

## Portfolio Project Notice

This is a **portfolio demonstration project** showcasing modern JavaScript security practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### Container Security

- Non-root user execution in Docker containers
- Multi-stage builds with minimal attack surface
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Code Security

- Dependency vulnerability scanning with `npm audit`
- ESLint security plugin for static analysis
- Environment variable configuration (no hardcoded secrets)

### Runtime Security

- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Structured logging for audit trails

## Security Tools Demonstrated

- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **audit-ci**: Automated security checks in CI/CD
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static code analysis
- **Docker Security**: Container hardening practices

---

_This project demonstrates security-conscious development practices suitable for enterprise environments._

- Critical: 1-7 days
- High: 1-30 days
- Medium: 30-90 days
- Low: Best effort

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**

   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for sensitive data**

   ```bash
   # .env file (never commit this)
   PROXY_USERNAME=your-username
   PROXY_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

3. **Limit scraping scope**
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Use appropriate delays
   - Don't overwhelm target servers

4. **Review scraped data**
   - Don't store sensitive information
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Follow GDPR/privacy regulations

### For Developers

1. **Input validation**
   - All URLs are validated
   - Use Zod schemas for data validation
   - Sanitize scraped content

2. **Dependency security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Error handling**
   - Don't expose internal paths
   - Log security events
   - Fail securely

## Known Security Considerations

### Web Scraping Risks

1. **Target site security**
   - Some sites may have anti-scraping measures
   - Rate limiting and IP blocking
   - Legal considerations (terms of service)

2. **Data handling**
   - Scraped content may contain malicious scripts
   - Personal data privacy concerns
   - Storage security

3. **Proxy usage**
   - Free proxies may be compromised
   - Proxy providers may log traffic
   - Consider privacy implications

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Content sanitization**

   ```javascript
   // Example: Remove scripts from scraped content
   const cleanContent = content.replace(
     /<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi,
     ''
   )
   ```

2. **Rate limiting**

   ```javascript
   // Built-in delays for politeness
   const delay = 500 + Math.random() * 1000
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay))
   ```

3. **Secure configuration**
   ```javascript
   // Don't log sensitive data
   const safeRequest = {
     url: request.url,
     // Don't log potential auth headers
   }
   ```

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- Data minimization: Only collect necessary data
- Purpose limitation: Use data only for intended purposes
- Storage limitation: Don't store data longer than needed
- Right to erasure: Implement data deletion capabilities

### Ethical Scraping

- Respect robots.txt files
- Use reasonable delays between requests
- Don't overload target servers
- Respect copyright and terms of service

## Security Tools

This project uses:

- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Detects security anti-patterns
- **npm audit**: Vulnerability scanning
- **audit-ci**: CI/CD security checks
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure:

1. Security researchers are encouraged to report vulnerabilities
2. We will work with researchers to verify and fix issues
3. Credit will be given to researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
4. We will coordinate disclosure timing with researchers
